lita Cookbook Changelog
========================

v0.0.3 (2014-08-12)
-------------------
- Added the rest of the standard Lita attributes (mention name and http properties) (issue #2)
- Added new "gems" attribute to add in custom gem setups. This allowed me to remove the pagerduty-sdk logic in the Gemfile.erb
- Turned the package installation into an attribute so native packages can be added as needed by adapter or handlers
- Fixed single/double quote stuff in the recipe. I'm not very consistent with that stuff

v0.0.2 (2014-07-23)
-------------------
- Initial version
